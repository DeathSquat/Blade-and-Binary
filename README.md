## 🛠️ How to Run or Edit the Project

You can easily contribute and customize the codebase using any of the following methods:

---

### 💻 Set Up Locally with Your IDE

> Recommended for full control and offline development.

#### 📦 Prerequisite: Node.js & npm

We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage Node.js versions.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Navigate to the project folder
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, with hot-reload for fast feedback.
